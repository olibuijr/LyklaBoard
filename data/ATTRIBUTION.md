## Icelandic Language Data: BÍN (Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls)

### Credit

This application uses language data derived from **BÍN** (Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls), a comprehensive morphological database of Modern Icelandic.

**© Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies**  
https://bin.arnastofnun.is

Icelandic morphological data and lemma information is provided courtesy of the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.

### License Terms (as applied to this project)

The BÍN dataset is made available under conditions that permit:

1. **Use in software applications** — Permitted. This keyboard extension uses BÍN-derived lemma indices and inflection mappings to power morphology-aware autocorrect.

2. **Credit required** — This attribution is displayed in the app's Settings → About section (containing app code credits).

3. **Restrictions on redistribution**:
   - **No raw-data redistribution**: The raw BÍN inflection paradigm data is not redistributed or republished.
   - **No publishing of inflection paradigms**: Users of this app are not presented with, and the app does not export, complete inflection paradigms from BÍN. The app shows only:
     - Lemmatized forms (base word)
     - Individual inflected suggestions (matched to user keystrokes)
     - Frequency ranks and grammatical categories (parts of speech)
   - Raw paradigm tables (all cases, numbers, genders for a single lemma) are never displayed or exported.

### Clearance

These terms were confirmed via email with the Árni Magnússon Institute (dated 2026-07-15) for this specific use case. The lemma-is project has previously navigated the same restrictions and precedent applies.

## English Language Data: SymSpell

This application uses English frequency dictionary data from the **SymSpell** open-source project.

### Frequency Data Attribution

The English frequency dictionary (`en-80k.txt`) derives from:

1. **Google Books Ngram Dataset v2** (public domain)  
   https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html

2. **Hunspell Dictionaries** (multiple open-source licenses: LGPL, GPL, MPL, etc.)  
   https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries

SymSpell combines these two sources by intersection to produce a high-quality frequency dictionary suitable for spell-checking and autocorrect use cases.

## Evaluation Data: Icelandic Error Corpus (IceEC)

### Credit

The compound-error evaluation slice (`data/eval/compounds.jsonl`, wave 31) derives from the **Icelandic Error Corpus (IceEC)**:

> https://github.com/antonkarl/iceErrorCorpus

### License

IceEC is distributed under the **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0)** — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. The derived rows in `data/eval/compounds.jsonl` (typo→correction pairs filtered to the compound error classes, selected and reshaped by `data/eval/generate-compounds-eval.py`) are redistributed under the same terms with this attribution. Changes made: filtering to compound-shaped error codes, dedup, shape normalization, and replay-form transformation — documented in the generator script and `data/eval/README.md`.

A further 16 rows in the same file derive from **GreynirCorrect** test assertions (Miðeind ehf., MIT license — https://github.com/mideind/GreynirCorrect); each row's `source` field records its origin. The full harvest provenance is in `research/mideind-compound-cases.md`.

Evaluation data only: these files feed `type-eval` and are not part of the shipped app bundle.
