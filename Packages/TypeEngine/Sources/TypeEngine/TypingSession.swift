///    becomes a committing delimiter once the next event shows whitespace/
///    another delimiter after it ("word. " commits; "word.t" keeps growing
///    one dotted token),

///    suggestions (single-letter prefixes hit the 20k-entry completion scan
///    cap on is.lex, ~2.8 ms/call; 2+ char prefixes have far smaller
///    ranges; an empty current word is next-word prediction, which is
///    cheap),
