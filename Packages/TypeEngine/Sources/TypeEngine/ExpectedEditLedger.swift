/// Ledger of the proxy edits the keyboard itself performed — the azooKey
/// "expected-edit tracker" pattern (research/oss-harvest.md §2:
/// `ExpectedEditTracker.swift` + `DisplayedTextManager.swift` in
/// azooKey/azooKey, MIT; the *pattern* is the harvest, not the code).
///
/// Every proxy mutation the embedder issues (keystroke insert, backspace,
/// autocorrect apply, suggestion tap, revert-on-continuation edit,
/// punctuation attachment, mode-2 prediction insert) is recorded as one
/// expected before → after transform of the truncated before-cursor window.
/// When the next window observation arrives (`TypingSession.suggestions
/// (for:)`), it is matched against the pending expectations:
///
///  * observation == a pending record's `after`  → the change is exactly
///    what we did ourselves (possibly several back-to-back edits confirmed
///    at once); the confirmed records are consumed,
///  * observation == the oldest record's `before` → a stale proxy read
///    (the host has not echoed our edit yet); nothing consumed, the edit
///    should confirm on a later observation,
///  * anything else → EXTERNAL: cursor jump, host mutation, autofill — or
///    an ambiguity resolved conservatively. The session resets pending-word
///    state exactly as `noteExternalTextChange()` would.
///
/// Degradation rules (a keyboard extension must never wedge):
///  * a record unconfirmed after `expiryObservations` observations means
///    the host swallowed the edit — the whole chain is unconfirmable and is
///    dropped (the session falls back to its heuristic window classifier),
///  * a recorded edit whose `before` does not chain onto the previous
///    record (or onto the last observation) means something external
///    happened between our own edits — the next observation is classified
///    external,
///  * more than `capacity` unobserved edits means the observation pipeline
///    is broken — same conservative external-once-then-adopt outcome.
