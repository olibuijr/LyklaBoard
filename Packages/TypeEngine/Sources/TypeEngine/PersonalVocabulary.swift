/// Engine-facing view of the user's personal learning store — the injection
/// seam for M2 personal learning (PLAN.md "Learning").
///
/// Production conformance is `PersonalSnapshot` (below), which adapts a
/// `Learning.PersonalModel` loaded from the App Group container. Tests and
/// the type-repl harness use small in-memory doubles.
///
/// Semantics the engine derives from this view:
///
/// - **Valid personal words** (`allWords()`: learned + user-added, never
///   tombstoned) are treated like lexicon-valid vocabulary: never
///   auto-corrected away, always admissible as suggestion candidates, and
///   boosted in ranking by a personal-source prior (see
///   `EngineConfig.personalBoost*` — an additive score bonus scaled
///   ~log(1+count), NOT a probability normalization: personal token totals
///   are far too small to blend with corpus-scale probabilities, the same
///   apples-to-oranges problem `LexiconCalibration` documents).
/// - **Tombstoned words** are never suggested and never predicted — even
///   when the base lexicons know them — but typed verbatim they behave like
///   any valid word (no correction): deletion means "stop suggesting", not
///   "punish typing".
/// - **Lane posterior**: personal words contribute NO lane evidence in v1.
///   Their language attribution comes from the engine's own lane belief at
///   commit time, so feeding it back would be a self-confirming loop (a
///   sletta committed while the lane was wrong would drag the lane further
///   wrong); and personal counts are orders of magnitude below the corpus
///   evidence they'd be blended with. `laneEvidence` stays base-corpus-only;
///   OOV personal words keep the existing neutral-decay behavior, which is
///   already the conservative right answer.
///
/// Threading: implementations are queried only on the engine's owning queue
/// (the same confinement contract as `TypeEngine` itself). Snapshot swaps
/// happen via `TypeEngine.setPersonalVocabulary`, also on that queue.
