///
///  * a tap near the boundary toward a neighbor makes that neighbor's

///    the ~1-nat static key-distance price (corrections get ENABLED),
///  * a dead-center tap prices every neighbor substitution near the
///    Gaussian exponent of a full key pitch (≈ 7 nats at the TSI σx),
///    capped at `maxSubstitution` — the correction VETO: believe the user.
///
/// STAGE 2 (this wave — the per-user adaptive touch model): when a
/// `PersonalTouchSnapshot` is injected, every key whose effective sample
/// count clears `EngineConfig.touchPersonalMinSamples` is priced against
/// its PERSONAL Gaussian — mean-shifted center, per-key covariance —
/// shrunk toward the TSI prior by w = n/(n + touchPriorStrength):
///

///
/// Because per-key Gaussians now differ, the ½·ln|Σ| normalizer no longer
/// cancels between keys; it is carried per key RELATIVE to the prior's
/// (so prior-priced keys keep the exact stage-1 numbers). Numerical
/// safety, per key: blended σ floored at `touchSigmaFloor`, correlation
/// clamped to |ρ| ≤ 0.9, and any non-finite/degenerate aggregate drops the
/// key back to the static prior — a corrupt personal model can never
/// poison pricing, and every priced cost still passes the existing
/// `minSubstitution`/`maxSubstitution` clamps. With no snapshot, or no key
/// past the gate, the arithmetic is the stage-1 code path, byte-identical.
///
/// Deliberate carve-outs:
///  * positions with no usable tap (nil sample, char/alignment drift, or a
///    character with no key position) fall back to the static
///    `SpatialModel` cost — absent evidence must not change behavior,
///  * orthographic-confusion pairs (d→ð, t→þ, o→ö, ð↔þ) keep the static
///    confusion constant regardless of the tap: those are COGNITIVE slips —
///    the user deliberately hit the key they (wrongly) believed right, so
///    the tap point carries no information about the confusion,
///  * accent twins share their base key's center AND its personal
///    statistics (long-press callouts carry no tap sample, so the physical
