/// Per-position character-level likelihood seam for the beam decoder.
///
/// The decoder prices every hypothesized "the user tapped `typed` but meant
/// `intended`" substitution through this protocol instead of calling the
/// static `SpatialModel` directly, because coordinate evidence will later
/// flow in PER TAP (PLAN.md "Touch decoding", stage 1) — and it works both
/// directions:
///
///  * a tap that landed near a key BOUNDARY makes the neighbor substitution
///    cheap (enables corrections the static model prices at ~1 nat anyway),
///  * a tap that landed DEAD CENTER makes every substitution expensive — a
///    correction veto: believe the user, they hit exactly what they meant.
///
/// `confidence(position:)` exists for the same wave: the corrector will
/// aggregate per-word tap confidence to modulate the autocorrect margin
/// (a word typed with all-center taps should almost never auto-replace).
/// Today the only concrete provider is the static keyboard-geometry one
/// below, whose confidence is a constant — the seam exists so the
/// coordinate-plumbing wave swaps providers without touching the beam.

// MARK: - Beam decoder

/// Beam-search spatial decoder: finds lexicon words reachable from the typed
/// token by spatially-plausible edits, by walking typed characters and a
/// lexicon prefix cursor in lockstep (uniform-cost search over
/// (prefix range, chars consumed) states).
///
/// This replaces the edits1/edits2 generate-and-test passes as the PRIMARY
/// candidate source: instead of materializing ~500–150k candidate strings
/// and probing each against the lexicon (~30µs a probe — the koetip 31ms
/// landmine), the search only ever visits prefixes the lexicon actually
/// contains, so multi-position adjacent-key noise ("koetip" → "kortið",
/// two 1-nat substitutions) is found in well under a millisecond.
///
/// Walk representation: per typed CHARACTER (extended grapheme cluster; for
/// this alphabet always a single scalar, 1–2 UTF-8 bytes). Every descend
/// appends one whole character's UTF-8 to the byte-sorted pool cursor, so
/// cursors stay scalar-aligned by construction — the byte-sortedness of the
/// pool is an implementation detail the decoder never observes partially.
///
/// Ops per state (all costs in nats, same currency as `SpatialModel`):
///  * match          — consume typed char, descend by it, cost 0
///  * substitution   — consume typed char, descend by a NEIGHBOR character,
///                     priced per position by the `PositionCostProvider`;
///                     the first edit may substitute ANY alphabet character
///                     (parity with the old edits1), later edits only the
///                     precomputed cheap-neighbor set (≤ beamNeighborMaxCost
///                     from static key geometry — a slightly generous
///                     superset that stays valid when coordinate evidence
///                     shifts costs around a tap point, since taps are
///                     spatially local)
///  * transposition  — consume two typed chars, descend in swapped order
///  * deletion       — consume typed char without descending (user typed an
///                     unintended extra character; `Costs.insertion`)
///  * insertion      — descend without consuming (user omitted an intended
///                     character; `Costs.deletion`), including after the
///                     last typed char
///
/// States dedup on (range lower bound, byte depth, chars consumed) — that
