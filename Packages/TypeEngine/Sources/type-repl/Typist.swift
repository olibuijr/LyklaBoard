///   window, never the full document,
/// - typing a word delimiter while the bar holds an `.autocorrect`
///   suggestion first replaces the current word (delete-backward x n +
///   insert), mirroring KeyboardKit's `StandardActionHandler` space-commit.
///   Like the extension's action-handler subclass, '.' does NOT apply the
///   pending autocorrect (the commit decision for a trailing dot is
///   deferred to the next keystroke — URLs/domains must survive); set
///   `appliesAutocorrectOnDot` to model STOCK KeyboardKit behavior, which
///   applies on '.' and relies on revert-on-continuation to self-heal,
/// - before inserting a letter/digit the session is offered the
///   revert-on-continuation decision (`continuationRevert(for:)`) and any
///   returned instruction is executed as proxy edits, exactly like the
///   extension's action-handler hook,
/// - tapping a suggestion replaces the current token and inserts a space
///   (KeyboardKit `insertAutocompleteSuggestion` semantics); verbatim taps
///   are reported to the session so autocorrect is suppressed for that
///   token,
/// - cursor jumps / host mutations notify the session via
///   `noteExternalTextChange()` and trigger a refresh, which is what a
