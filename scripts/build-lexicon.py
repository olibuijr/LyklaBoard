--bin-lookup/--bin-lemmas (Icelandic only) enable two ranking-noise prunes —
see load_bin_forms(), prune_non_bin_unigrams(), accent_dominance_filter()
docstrings below and "## .lex artifacts" in data/README.md for the full
rationale and before/after counts:
  1. drop unigrams that aren't BÍN surface forms, except the --bin-topk most
     frequent non-BÍN words and any at/above --bin-high-freq (foreign names,
     orgs, loanwords survive; typos/junk like "hester" don't)
  2. drop an unaccented word when an accented variant has >= --accent-ratio
     times its frequency (e.g. "islenskar" vs "íslenskar")

Input formats (auto-detected by gzip magic bytes):
  --unigrams: either
    - text, one entry per line: "word<space>count" (e.g. data/en/en-80k.txt)
    - gzipped JSON object {word: count, ...} (e.g. data/is/unigrams.json.gz)
  --bigrams: either
    - text, one entry per line: "word1 word2<space>count"
      (e.g. data/en/frequency_bigramdictionary_en_243_342.txt)
    - gzipped JSON. Two shapes are accepted:
        - a list of [word1, word2, count] triples
          (this is the actual shape of data/is/bigrams.json.gz)
        - an object {"word1 word2": count, ...} or {word1: {word2: count}}
          (accepted defensively; not required by the shipped data)

Normalization: lowercase + NFC, curly apostrophe (U+2019) folded to straight
ASCII apostrophe ('), keep only tokens matching
^[a-zþðæöáéíóúý]+('[a-zþðæöáéíóúý]+)*$ (ASCII letters + Icelandic-specific
letters, with internal apostrophes allowed for contractions/possessives like
"don't"/"o'clock" — a leading, trailing, or doubled apostrophe still fails
the match). Everything else (digits, punctuation, multi-token phrases) is
dropped. Bigrams where either word fails that filter, or where either word
isn't in the (filtered) unigram set, are dropped entirely — bigrams never
grow the unigram vocabulary. Duplicate keys (after normalization) have their
counts summed before scaling.

Contraction backfill: a curated list of common English contractions
(CONTRACTION_EXPANSIONS below) is checked after loading unigrams. Any that
are already present in the source are left untouched (as of the 2026-07-15
en-80k.txt, all of them are — SymSpell's list already includes "don't",
"i'm", "can't", etc.; the historical bug was the WORD_RE filter above
silently deleting them after loading, not a gap in the source itself). Any
curated contraction still missing after that is assigned a derived
frequency: freq(contraction) = bigram_freq(uncontracted phrase) // 2, using
the *raw* (pre-filter) bigram source's "word1 word2" count for the
contraction's expansion (e.g. freq("don't") ≈ bigram_freq("do", "not") // 2).
This is a same-corpus proxy (Google Ngram unigram and bigram counts are
comparable orders of magnitude — see FORMAT.md scaling notes) used only as a
fallback so the table degrades gracefully if a future source drops a
contraction; it does not fire against the current shipped data. Contractions
with no matching bigram entry are left absent rather than guessed at.

Contraction repair (v3, --contraction-repair, English only): backfill only
covers a contraction going *missing*; it does not fix one that is *present
but undercounted*, which is the actual bug found by the harness (2026-07-16
task #10) — en-80k.txt's own unigram counts for contractions run 10-40x
below independently-plausible values (e.g. raw "don't"=188,045 vs "font"
=2,568,450), because Google Ngram-derived unigram extraction evidently
undercounts apostrophe-tokens relative to their real usage (and, for
contractions whose bare skeleton is *also* a real dictionary word, e.g.
"cant"/"wont"/"lets", some of the contraction's mass was likely miscounted
into that bare word instead). See repair_contraction_frequencies() below for
the full method: it derives an independent frequency estimate for each
contraction from the bigram source's *own internal* conditional
probabilities (avoiding the false assumption above that unigram and bigram
counts share a scale — they don't, see the function docstring), raises the
contraction's frequency to at least that estimate, and — only when the
estimate alone already exceeds the bare skeleton's observed count, i.e. only
when the skeleton's own frequency isn't independently explainable — folds
down the skeleton's frequency (with a floor) to reflect that most of it was
probably misattributed contraction mass.

Frequencies are scaled to fit u32 when source counts exceed it (English
counts do; Icelandic counts don't). See FORMAT.md "Scaling to u32" for the
exact algorithm — it's also implemented below in scale_to_u32().

    """Correct undercounted English contraction frequencies (task #10,
    2026-07-16): en-80k.txt's own unigram counts for contractions are
    10-40x below independently-plausible values (raw "don't"=188,045 vs
    "font"=2,568,450 — nobody types "font" more than 13x as often as
    "don't"). This makes the beam decoder's lane-relaxation apostrophe fold
    (PLAN.md "EN apostrophe folding dont->don't... ~ε") offer-only instead
    of auto-applying: the folded target's frequency is too low to win, and
    for contractions whose bare skeleton is *also* a real word (can't/cant,
    won't/wont), the skeleton's frequency is backwards-dominant over the
    contraction, which is exactly the wrong direction for the collision
    dominance gate PLAN.md describes for the accent-folding mirror case.

    Method — independent frequency estimate via the bigram file's own
    internal conditional probabilities:

    A tempting shortcut is "use bigram_freq(do, not) as a proxy for
    freq(don't)" (this is literally what --contraction-backfill already
    does as a *missing-entry* fallback). But en-80k.txt (unigrams) and
    frequency_bigramdictionary_en_243_342.txt (bigrams) are NOT the same
    corpus scale — verified empirically here: the single most reliable
    unigram ("the"=26,548,583,149) is smaller than the single most reliable
    bigram ("of the"=177,045,273,024), which is logically impossible within
    one consistent corpus (a bigram can never occur more often than either
    of its own words) and proves the two SymSpell-derived files come from
    differently-scaled extractions. Worse, the size of that mismatch is not
    a fixed ratio: measured per-pair ("of the" vs "the": 6.7x; "in the" vs
    "in": 12.3x; "do not" vs "do": 37.4x), it varies enough that no single
    global divisor gives trustworthy absolute numbers (previously tried and
    rejected during this fix: it put contractions above "the" itself).

    What *is* reliable across the two files is a conditional PROBABILITY,
    not an absolute count: P(w2 | w1) = bigram_freq(w1, w2) / (total bigram
    mass starting with w1) is a same-corpus ratio (computed entirely inside
    the bigram file), and this fraction is assumed to transfer reasonably
    well onto the unigram file's trusted count for w1 (word-pair grammar
    doesn't shift much between corpus vintages, even if absolute corpus
    size does). So each contraction's expansion phrase (w1, w2) gets two
    independent projections back onto the unigram file's scale:

        est_via_w1 = unigram_freq(w1) * bigram_freq(w1,w2) / fanout(w1, *)
        est_via_w2 = unigram_freq(w2) * bigram_freq(*,w2) / fanout(*, w2)

    and the estimate used is min(est_via_w1, est_via_w2) — the more
    conservative of the two directions, so a skewed fan-out on either side
    can only push the estimate down, never up. Sanity-checked against known
    frequencies in en-80k.txt: this method puts "don't" (~290M) in the same
    tier as "should"/"would"/"could" (407M/736M/443M) and "can't" (~143M)
    above "house" (158M) but below "will" (742M) — plausible for words this
    common in casual (mobile-typed) English, unlike the raw source's
    "don't"=188,045 (below "font").

    Skeleton reassignment: a contraction's bare skeleton (apostrophe
    stripped, e.g. "cant") is only ever adjusted, never for contractions
    whose skeleton is absent from the source (nothing to reassign). When
    present, the skeleton is reduced ONLY IF the independent phrase estimate
    above already exceeds the skeleton's observed frequency — i.e. only
    when the evidence says the "true" contraction volume alone is bigger
    than what's currently sitting in the skeleton bucket, meaning the
    skeleton's own count doesn't need an "it's also a genuine independent
    word" explanation to account for it. This is a self-consistent gate,
    not a hardcoded per-word judgment call: it naturally leaves real,
    independently-dominant collision words alone (measured: "its" stays
    untouched — 684,717,118 vs an "it's" estimate of ~397M, i.e. estimate <
    skeleton; same for "were"/we're and "ill"/i'll) while correcting the
    cases where the skeleton is mostly contraction leakage (measured:
    "cant" 996,416 vs "can't" estimate ~143M, "wont" 1,862,783 vs "won't"
    estimate ~63M, "lets" 3,004,900 vs "let's" estimate ~10M, "whats"
    67,648 vs "what's" estimate ~55M — all get folded down). When folding
    down, `skeleton_floor_fraction` (default 0.1, --contraction-skeleton-
    floor) keeps at least that fraction of the observed skeleton count
    rather than zeroing it — per PLAN.md's "keep a floor so genuinely-typed
    'dont' still ranks", some of the skeleton spelling is presumably still
    deliberately typed even where evidence says most of it is a corpus
    artifact.

    Never applied to CONTRACTION_EXPANSIONS' English word pairs against a
    non-English bigram source, same rationale as --contraction-backfill.

    own lemma with no other lemma/POS ambiguity, since a lemma-lookup index

    pronouns ("hann", "ég"), nominative-singular nouns ("hestur"), adverbs

    would flag roughly a third of all common Icelandic words as "non-BÍN"
    noise. The fix: union `lookup.tsv.gz`'s keys (inflected/ambiguous forms)
    with `lemmas.txt.gz` (one lemma per line — the base forms) to get the
    complete surface-form set.

    `lookup.tsv.gz` format: `word\\tidx1:pos1,idx2:pos2,...` (first column is
