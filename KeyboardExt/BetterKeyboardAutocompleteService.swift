//  M1: bridges TypeEngine (bilingual IS/EN corrector + predictor) into
//  KeyboardKit's `AutocompleteService`. KeyboardKit calls
//  `autocomplete(_:)` with all text before the input cursor
//  (`documentContextBeforeInput`) on every text change; the returned
//  `Autocomplete.ServiceResult` is synced into `AutocompleteContext`, which
//  the standard `Autocomplete.Toolbar` renders, and suggestions marked
//  `.autocorrect` are auto-applied by `KeyboardAction.StandardActionHandler`
//  when the user types a word/sentence delimiter (space etc.).
//
//  All session logic (context/current-word parsing, the ≥2-char gate,
//  word-commit detection feeding the language posterior) lives in
//  `TypeEngine.TypingSession`, shared verbatim with the macOS `type-repl`
//  harness — this file only owns threading, artifact bootstrap, and the
//  KeyboardKit suggestion mapping.
//
//  Privacy: no networking, no typed content in logs (only timings/counts).
