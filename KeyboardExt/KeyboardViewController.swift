///    know whether the dot ends a sentence or continues a URL/domain. Our
///    `shouldApplyAutocorrectSuggestion` excludes '.', so the dot inserts
///    literally and the session keeps the token pending ("teh.").
/// 2. **Deferred apply**: when the NEXT delimiter arrives (space/return/…),
///    the session's re-armed suggestion ("the.") must be applied even
///    though KeyboardKit now considers the cursor "at a new word" (its own
///    word boundary stops at the dot). We allow that apply exactly when

///    next keystroke is a letter/digit, the session orders a proxy edit
///    that restores the originally typed token before the new character is
///    inserted — URLs self-heal ("prófílmynd." → "profilmynd.t…").
/// 4. **Verbatim taps**: tapping the quoted `.unknown` escape-hatch slot
///    commits the literal token (KeyboardKit inserts tapped suggestions
///    as-is and never re-applies an autocorrect on that path — the
///    follow-up `handle(.release, on: .character(""))` is not an
///    autocorrect trigger); we additionally tell the session, so a

//     the cursor ends in two spaces, the cursor is at a new word, the
//     previous sentence isn't already closed, and the second tap landed
//     within `endSentenceThreshold` (3s default) of the first.
//   - `KeyboardAction.StandardActionHandler.tryEndCurrentSentence(after:on:)`
//     calls that check unconditionally as part of every `handle(_:on:)`,
//     then does `textDocumentProxy.endSentence(withText: ". ")`, which
//     deletes the trailing spaces and inserts ". ".
//
// Both `services.keyboardBehavior` and `services.actionHandler` are left
// at their KeyboardKit defaults (`Keyboard.StandardKeyboardBehavior` /
// `KeyboardAction.StandardActionHandler`) in this file, so this fires as-is.
// Regression coverage: `Keyboard_StandardKeyboardBehaviorTests
// .testShouldEndSentenceOnlyForSpaceAfterPreviousSpace` (upstream, already
// in the vendored test suite) plus the new
// `KeyboardAction_SpaceSequencingTests` in
// `Packages/KeyboardKit/Tests/KeyboardKitTests/Actions/` (added for this

// single space or disturb the mode-1 autocorrect-on-space commit (PLAN.md
// "Spacebar behavior").
