// MARK: - Double-space → ". " (built-in, no code needed)

// PLAN.md bottom-row affordance #3 ("Double-space → '. '") turned out to
// already be a fully wired KeyboardKit 9.9.1 feature, not something to
// implement:
//
//   - `Keyboard.StandardKeyboardBehavior.shouldEndCurrentSentence(after:on:)`
//     (`Packages/KeyboardKit/Sources/KeyboardKit/_Keyboard/Keyboard+StandardKeyboardBehavior.swift`)
//     returns true on `.release` of `.space` when the proxy's text before
//     the cursor ends in two spaces, the cursor is at a new word, the
//     previous sentence isn't already closed, and the second tap landed
//     within `endSentenceThreshold` (3s default) of the first.
//   - `KeyboardAction.StandardActionHandler.tryEndCurrentSentence(after:on:)`
//     calls that check unconditionally as part of every `handle(_:on:)`,
//     then does `textDocumentProxy.endSentence(withText: ". ")`, which
//     deletes the trailing spaces and inserts ". ".
//
// Both `services.keyboardBehavior` and `services.actionHandler` are left
// at their KeyboardKit defaults (`Keyboard.StandardKeyboardBehavior` /
// `KeyboardAction.StandardActionHandler`) in this file, so this fires as-is.
// Regression coverage: `Keyboard_StandardKeyboardBehaviorTests
// .testShouldEndSentenceOnlyForSpaceAfterPreviousSpace` (upstream, already
// in the vendored test suite) plus the new
// `KeyboardAction_SpaceSequencingTests` in
// `Packages/KeyboardKit/Tests/KeyboardKitTests/Actions/` (added for this
// change), which exercises the same behavior end-to-end through
// `StandardActionHandler.handle(_:on:)` and confirms it doesn't fire on a
// single space or disturb the mode-1 autocorrect-on-space commit (PLAN.md
// "Spacebar behavior").
